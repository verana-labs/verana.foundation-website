# Verana

## What is the Verana Foundation?

Digital trust is collapsing due to AI-driven fraud, deepfakes, and regulatory complexity. Businesses need better privacy, automation, and compliance, while consumers, overwhelmed by privacy concerns, present both risks and opportunities for new trust models.

Verana's mission is to provide a new, decentralized, and universal trust layer to make the Internet verifiable.

Like the DNS (Domain Name System) provides a way of resolving domain names, Verana is building the bricks to resolve, verify, and prove trust.

- DNS: Resolve domain names
- Verana: Resolve Proof of Trust

Verana is a decentralized verifiable public registry run by volunteers around the world. Anyone can participate by running a network node, contribute to the code repository, be an essential credential schema issuer, or simply use the network.

Verana is used by Ecosystems that want to create Trust Registries, define Verifiable Credential schemas, create permission rules for issuing and verifying credentials of their schemas, so that we can easily verify the following:

- Does Issuer A is 

Participants build a Proof-of-Trust reputation over time, and are financially rewarded by the network for their trustworthiness.

## based on open standards, focused on privacy, with a business model, and open to anyone

### Based on open standards

- Uses w3c Verifiable Credentials to identify services and providers.
- Rely on Decentralized Identifiers for service identification.

### Focused on Privacy

- no private data in a centralized database
- ecosystem public permissions are stored in a distributed, immutable ledger: the Verana network.
- GDPR compliant.
- no "phone home" to verify credential content.
- privacy preserving business models.

### Open to anyone

Anyone can create a Trust Registry, Credential Schemas, and define who can issue and verify credentials of this schemas.

```plantuml

@startuml
scale max 800 width
 
package "Verana Network" as dtr {

    object "Trust Registry #A" as tra #3fbdb6 {

    }

    object "Trust Registry #B" as trb #3fbdb6 {

    }

    object "Trust Registry #C" as trc #3fbdb6 {

    }

    object "Trust Registry #D" as trd #3fbdb6 {

    }
    object "Trust Registry #E" as tre #3fbdb6 {

    }
    
   
}


@enduml

```

A Trust Registry defines a EGF (Ecosystem Governance Framework) and one or more credential schemas.

```plantuml

@startuml
scale max 800 width
 
object "Trust Registry" as tra #3fbdb6 {
    ecosystem identifier
    credential schemas
    ecosystem governance framework documents
}


@enduml

```

For each Credential Schema, the Trust Registry define the rules for issuing and verifying credentials of these schemas

```plantuml

@startuml
scale max 800 width

object "Trust Registry A" as tra 

    object "Credential Schema #A1" as csa1 #3fbdb6

    object "Issuer Grantor #A1" as iga1 {
        ISSUER_GRANTOR permission(s)
    }
    object "Issuer #A1" as ia1 #7677ed {
        ISSUER permission(s)
    }
    object "Issuer and Verifier #A2" as iva2 #AA77ed {
        ISSUER permission(s)
        VERIFIER permission(s)
    }
    object "Verifier #A1" as va1 #00b0f0 {
        VERIFIER permission(s)
    }
    object "Verifier Grantor #A1" as vga1 {
        VERIFIER_GRANTOR permission(s)
    }
    object "Holder Wallet" as au







tra --> csa1 : creates credential schema(s)
csa1 --> iga1 : grants permission to validate issuers to
csa1 --> vga1 : grants permission to validate verifiers to
iga1 --> iva2 : grants credential issuance to
iga1 --> ia1 : grants credential issuance to
vga1 --> va1 : grants credential verification to
vga1 --> iva2 : grants credential verification to
iva2 --> au : issue credential to
au --> va1 : present credential to

```

### Plug and play business model

For a given credential schema, trust registry define the rules (including business rules) for onboarding schema participants in their EGF, as well as the issuance and verification of credentials.

Business models are of 2 kinds:

- Onboarding: thanks to a Validation Process, participants can obtain a permission as Grantor, Issuer or Verifier of a given credential schema.
- Pay per issuance and pay per verification of credentials: each participant permission defines its own business model.

Permissions forms a permission tree

#### Onboarding

Onboarding is done through a Validation Process which is run between an Applicant (future participant) and a Validator (existing participant).

```plantuml

@startuml
scale max 800 width
 
package "Pay per issuance/verification Fee Structure" as cs {

    object "Trust Registry A - Credential Schema Root Permission" as tr #3fbdb6 {
        did:example:trA
        issuance cost: 10 TUs
        verification cost: 20 TUs
    }
    object "Issuer Grantor B - Credential Schema Permission" as ig {
        did:example:igB
        issuance cost: 5 TUs
        verification cost: 5 TUs
    }
    object "Issuer C - Credential Schema Permission" as issuer #7677ed  {
        did:example:iC
        verification cost: 30 TUs
    }
    object "Verifier Grantor D - Credential Schema Permission" as vg {
        did:example:vgD
        verification cost: 2 TUs
    }
    object "Verifier E - Credential Schema Permission" as verifier #00b0f0 {
        did:example:vE
    }
}



tr --> ig : granted schema permission
ig --> issuer : granted schema permission

tr --> vg : granted schema permission
vg --> verifier : granted schema permission

Issue credentials and get rewarded. Pay when you request data.

- charge/reward issuers
- charge/reward verifiers
- charge/reward holders
- reward User Agents providers
- reward Wallet User Agent providers

### Trust Deposit and Reputation

Any participant has a Trust Deposit. Trust deposit of a given participant increases each time participant pays trust fees or receives trust fees as reward.

For issuers, verifiers, grantors and credential schema owners:

- The more you issue and/or verify credentials, the more your Trust Deposit grows.
- The more your Trust Deposit grows, the higher your Trust Reputation.
- Severe service abuse, data leak,... can be punished by schema owners with a Trust Deposit slash. If you have been slashed, to continue to use the service, you need to reimburse the slashed trust deposit, else you cannot verify or issue credentials anymore.

Trust deposit produces yield which is paid to all Trust Deposit owners each time a block is added to the ledger.

## Governance and Leadership

As a non-profit organization, the Verana Foundation's mission is to provide the required bricks for enabling a Zero Trust layer: governance and leadership, open source software, and a verifiable public registry and essential credential schemas for identifying services and their providers.

The Verana Foundation is governed and leaded by its contributors, participants, and ambassadors.

### Software

Open source software and modules that implement the [Verifiable Trust specification](https://verana-labs.github.io/verifiable-trust-spec/)

### Essential Credential Schemas (ECS) Trust Registry

a Trust Registry of Essential Credential Schemas:

- Organization,
- Person,
- Service,
- User Agent.

These credential schemas provide the required basic features of the Zero Trust layer, that can be queried by users, organizations, user agents...:

- who is the organization or person running this service?
- what is the name of this service? What is the minimum required age for connecting to this service?
- is this user agent compliant with the Verifiable Trust specification?

A trust registry governance framework defines the rules for participating in the ECSs as credential Issuer. Provided that they comply with the Governance Framework, any organization can join the ECS Trust Registry.

## Benefits

Fraud and Identity theft are eradicated.

### For the End User

- identify, verify, and get a proof of who is the provider of a service before connecting to it.
- collect verifiable credentials from verified service providers.
- use your credentials to prove your identity, age, address, diplomas, avatar ownership. Use selective disclosure to only share essential information and protect your data.
- anonymously register and connect to services, without revealing public identifier(s) such as email or phone number, and without a password.
- stop using public identifiers and control who can contact you. Revoke connections at will.

### For Service Providers

- get your organization or person verifiable credential and link all your services to your credential so that users can clearly identify you and know they are connecting to the right service.
- ease user onboarding by removing registration forms and passwords.
- fast verify user's identity (and other claims) with no hassle.
- create hubs, meeting rooms, or other services protected by identity: users must present a credential to enter.
- issue Verifiable Credentials to your users, and get paid when other organizations request presentation of the credential to the user.
- build a verifiable trust reputation and be recognized.
- be searchable: add your services to the verifiable service directory
