Say "bye bye" to DNS and SSL. Say hello to Verifiable Trust and the Verifiable Public Registry.

- All our software is open-source.
- Total privacy preserving, no intermediaries, always deploy the service wherever you want.
- No hosting dependency: easily move your service from one datacenter to a new one.
- No phishing, no impersonation, no fraud: users know they are connecting to your real genuine service, not a scam.
