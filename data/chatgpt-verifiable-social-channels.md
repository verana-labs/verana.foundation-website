Verifiable Social Channels: A Decentralized & Reputation-Based Model
In a decentralized world, influencers and content creators should have full control over their communities while being accountable for their actions. This is where Verifiable Social Channels (VSCs) come in—social channels that are linked to a verifiable identity and governed by a trust-based system.

How It Works: Creating a Verifiable Social Channel
Identity & Verification

As an influencer, I decide to create my own social channel.

To make my channel verifiable, I link a Verifiable Credential (VC) to it—this could be my real identity, an avatar, or another verified persona.

This ensures that participants can verify that I am the true provider of this channel.

Getting Listed in a Social Browser

If I want my social channel to be discoverable, I may choose to list it on a Social Channel Browser (e.g., “Social Browser”).

To do so, I contact the Social Browser owner and purchase or obtain a Social Browser Verifiable Credential (VC).

I then link this VC to my social channel, making it visible within the Social Browser.

The Social Browser owner has full discretion over how they issue these credentials—they can sell them, give them away, or set specific criteria.

Growing My Social Channel & Trust Deposit

Once my social channel is published, I can start interacting with my followers, gaining new ones, and engaging in various social activities.

Some interactions may require followers to present credentials issued by other participants (e.g., proof of age, membership, or expertise).

These interactions may involve transaction fees, which contribute to my trust deposit—a reputation-based stake that grows as I build credibility.

Governance & Reputation: How Trust Deposits Work
A trust deposit is earned through positive interactions and participation in different ecosystems.

If I violate the governance framework of any ecosystem involved in my social channel, a portion of my trust deposit—the part associated with that ecosystem—can be slashed as a penalty.

If I interact with followers from Social Browser, my trust deposit linked to Social Browser grows.

However, if I fail to comply with Social Browser’s governance rules, Social Browser can penalize me by slashing the portion of my trust deposit associated with it.

Since my trust deposit is linked to multiple interactions and ecosystems, only the portion related to the violated governance is affected, ensuring fair enforcement.

The Benefits of a Verifiable Social Channel System
✅ Decentralized Trust & Moderation – No single entity controls moderation; governance is enforced through reputation-based penalties.
✅ Identity Verification Without Censorship – Users know who they interact with, but identity can still be pseudonymous (e.g., avatars).
✅ Scalable & Transparent Governance – Trust deposits provide a built-in incentive for ethical behavior without requiring central moderation.
✅ Multi-Layered Reputation System – My reputation is not tied to one entity, but distributed across all ecosystems I interact with.

This model eliminates the need for centralized censorship while ensuring that social channels remain responsible for their own governance—a true decentralized and trust-driven social experience.
