## Why we need a Verifiable Trust Network

- For all the reasons explained in [Why we need Verifiable Trust](/page/learn-vt-why);
- To provide monetization solutions to existing Ecosystems that use Verifiable Credentials - see [Business Models](/page/learn-vt-business-models);
- To allow anyone to create its Ecosystem and build its [Verifiable Reputation](/page/learn-vt-trust-deposit-and-reputation);
- To provide an unbiased Service [Directory and search engine](/page/learn-vt-service-directory), where returned results rely on verifiable data.
- To enable new kinds of self-hosted decentralized services.

## The Verana Verifiable Trust Network

Thanks to its founder members, since 2024, the Verana Foundation is working on an open-source implementation of a Cosmos-SDK based Verifiable Public Registry (VPR): [verana-blockchain](https://github.com/verana-labs/verana-blockchain).

- The [verana-blockchain](https://github.com/verana-labs/verana-blockchain) implementation is based on the v1 of the [VPR spec](https://github.com/verana-labs/verifiable-trust-vpr-spec).

Other related repositories are under active development, such as:

- The [verana-frontend](https://github.com/verana-labs/verana-frontend): a container-based open source frontend for Ecosystems, to manage Trust Registries, Credential Schemas, permissions, etc

- [verre](https://github.com/verana-labs/verre): a typescript library for resolving trust, as specified in the [Verifiable Trust spec](https://github.com/verana-labs/verifiable-trust-spec).

Website of the **Verana Verifiable Trust Network** will be https://verana.io and will be delivered in Q2/2025, when **testnet** launches.

## Essential Credential Schemas in the Verana Verifiable Trust Network

In the **Verana Verifiable Trust Network**, the **Verana Foundation** will:

- Operate a **Trust Registry** to define and manage ECSs
- Govern those ECSs through a transparent **Ecosystem Governance Framework**
- Select and validate global **Issuers** for each ECS
- Anchor each ECS as a verifiable credential (JSON Schema Credential) issued by the registry's DID

By doing so, Verana provides the trust anchor needed for decentralized applications and ecosystems to interoperate safely and confidently.

## Call to existing ecosystems, foundations and the identity industry

The Verana Foundation is a non profit organization.

As the **Verana Verifiable Trust Network** is a public good and include a crypto token (**VNA**) as the fuel for trust fees, **mainnet** launch will be done by involving all volunteer contributors. To make the network as decentralized as possible, the VNA token total supply will be fairly distributed including all project contributors, provided they demonstrate their fair involvement in this project and their adherence to the mission of the Verana Foundation.

Example of contributors (unordered) that qualify for token distribution at launch:

- Verana Foundation members
- Github Repository contributors
- Governance advocates
- Legal contributors
- Implementation of the Verifiable Trust layer in existing ecosystem projects: wallets, IDP software and services, etc
- Verana Foundation Ambassadors
- network validators (Entities that host Verana Verifiable Trust Network nodes as network validators)
- VCs
- Early adopters
- Essential Credential Schema (ECS) Issuers
- Community managers

Distributed amounts and vesting periods will depends on contribution start date and other criteria that are currently being defined - we'll keep the community updated.

## Mainnet launch

The launch of the **Verana Verifiable Trust Network**, the first public, decentralized and verifiable trust network, is currently scheduled for **Q1/2026**.
